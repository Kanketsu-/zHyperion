zHyperion
=========
zHyperion will be an open-source project; meaning you may download the source at anytime. I plan to develop a nice clean, user-friendly Hyperion for people to use with a good amount of content. Hopefully this will get people to start using Hyperion more, seeing how there isn't much Hyperion projects anymore.
